An important class of algorithmic changes involves blocking data structures to fit in cache. By organizing data memory accesses, one can load the cache with a small subset of a much larger data set. The idea is then to work on this block of data in cache. By using/reusing this data in cache we reduce the need to go to memory (reduce memory bandwidth pressure).
