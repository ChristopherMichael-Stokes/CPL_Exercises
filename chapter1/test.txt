Tiling is an optimization technique, usually applied to loops, that orders the application data accesses to maximize the number of cache hits. The idea is simple to illustrate: Imagine you are combining two lists of numbers to enter into a grid, such as a multiplication table, but you are doing so with a multiply machine that repetitively multiplies two numbers and tediously enters results.
